# Tumor_Classifier_Model
This Is My First Trained Model Using Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression)


I Dont KNow How To Start So HERE WE GO AGAIN!

Liberaries:

```python
import sklearn as sk
import pandas as  pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

Modules From Sklearn(Scikit-learn):

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
```

I Used Dataset From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

[Interesting Data to Visualize](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexisbcook/data-for-datavis?select=cancer.csv)-Cancer.csv

Don't Know Why He Thinks Cancer Is "INTERESTING" Thing To Happen!
